# 7-Questions-Or-Less
# Made by Liam Mitchell
CMU IEEE Club recruitment game, similar to 20 Questions. Raspberry Pi, Python, and Adafruit 16x2 LCD

# Comments were added in the .py file to help explain the program.
Intended to run on Raspberry Pi, when the Python program is executed in linux terminal it takes user input from the Adafruit LCD,
and searches QuestionTree.txt for the matching string of possible answers and reads the next question based on the 
combination of Yes and No Answers. 

# If the game were actually 20 Questions the text file would be about 2^20 = (1048576+) Questions/Answers/Lines of text in the file. 
# There are much better ways to program a game of that magnitude, this is a rather ineffecient program.


#Fun Facts about this project: Only took a semester of Python basic back in HighSchool, going to CMU to become EE.
#IEEE club originally created the game in Java before I took over. 
#From start to finish I completed this project over the course of 5 weekdays, includes installing device packages.
#Project was presented on campus at the 2016 ASEE (American Society of Engineering Education)
#In the future it will be used at CMU events such as "Mainstage", in attempt to grab peoples interest and recruit them to IEEE.


#I would also like to give a big thanks to Mark Schlax, a CSE and good friend of mine from MTU on helping with the timing delays.
